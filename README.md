# Ian's Page

This project contains a basic HTML page (`index.html`) styled with an external CSS file (`styles.css`). The page demonstrates:

- Proper use of CSS selectors and styling properties.
- Implementation of the CSS Box Model including padding, margin, and borders.
- Consistent spacing, sizing, and layout with flexbox.

## How to Use

1. Open this project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** to view the page in your browser.
3. Any changes you make to the `index.html` or `styles.css` files will automatically refresh in the browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML document with structured semantic elements.
- `styles.css`: External stylesheet defining the page style and layout.

## Notes

Make sure to have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code for the best development experience.
